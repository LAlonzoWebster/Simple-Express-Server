Stretch Your Thoughts: answer the following questions: 

 ** What else can you do with Node Packages? **
 NodeJS is a javascript runtime built in Chrome’s V8 engine. Node allows you to execute Javascript code outside of the browser, in a computing environment (such as a server or local development environment) rather then a browser environment.

There are 5 main things people use node for:
    + Package management through npm, bower, jspm, etc.
    + Development tooling (module management with webpack, task running and automation through grunt or gulp, linters like eslint or jslint, etc)
    + Creation of back-end web applications.
    + Command line tools like rimraf.
    + Desktop Applications

** What else can you do with Express? **
    + Web Applications - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
    + APIs - With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.
    + Performance - Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.
    + Frameworks - Many popular frameworks are based on Express.

** What other technologies could you use instead of Express? ** 
    + Fastify, as its name implies, was built with the intention of being a very fast Node.js web framework. Despite its main goal of speed, it actually does a very nice job of achieving our ideal controller syntax.

    + Koa is a sort of spiritual successor to Express.js, having been written by some of the original Express.js authors. It does support async functions out the door, but it doesn’t come with a router of its own. We can make use of koa-router to provide routing.

** How is hosting in Express different than how you've hosted before? ** 
I don't really know. I am still learning and can't tell you at this time.
